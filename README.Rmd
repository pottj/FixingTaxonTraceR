# FixingTaxonTraceR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of FixingTaxonTraceR is to check sets of taxon sets for fixing taxon traceability (FTT) in R as introduced in Algorithm 1 in paper "Perfect taxon sampling and fixing taxon traceability: Introducing a class of phylogenetically decisive taxon sets" (add link to publication/preprint server). 

In the setting $c=4$, FTT indicates phylogenetic decisiveness as defined by Sanderson and Steel.

## Installation

You can install the laterst version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pottj/FixingTaxonTraceR")
```

## Overview 

There are four basic functions implemented in this package: 

1)  _FTT_createInput_: The function reads in a .txt file with taxon lists (c-tuples or more) as indicated in the _fn_ parameter and transforms them to target format (only c-tuples, numbered, ordered). Each row in the text file defines one set. The parameter _sepSym_ allows different ways to separate the taxa within each set. 
2)  _FTT_initialChecks_: The function performs up to three initial checks: First, the bounds of the FTT algorithm are checked. If the number of c-tuples is above the upper or below the lower bound, then the FTT algorithm does not to have to be used as the result is fix. In case of for $c=4$, three properties of phylogenetic decisiveness are tested: 
    1) Are all triples covered? 
    2) Are triples with simple covered covered by different quadruples? 
    3) Are all tuples sufficiently covered?
3)  _FTT_algorithmGreen_: This function tests for FTT using the input c-tuples and checking if there are $c$ c-tuples so a cross c-tuple can be resolved. 
4)  _FTT_algorithmRed_: This function tests for FTT using the cross c-tuples and checking if there are $c$ c-tuples so it can be resolved. 

**Important Note 1**: In the manuscript, the algorithm refers to "white" and "gray" quadruple, while the R-implementation uses "green" and "red", respectively. This is only due to figure coloring costs, and does not change the algorithm itself. 

**Important Note 2**: Both _FTT_algorithmGreen_ and _FTT_algorithmRed_ lead to the same result, but depending on the input set, the computing time can differ, e.g. if there are only a few cross c-tuples, it will be more efficient to run _FTT_algorithmRed_.

To validate the results for $c=4$ regarding phylogenetic decisiveness, we also implemented the algorithm proposed by [Parvini, Braught, and Fern√°ndez-Baca](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-030-57821-3_17) in the function _FTT_findNRC_, which is based on no-rainbow coloring.
